# Spec: Progressive AI Voice Adoption During Persona Onboarding

## Overview
This spec extends the existing persona AI fine-tuning system to enable the AI to progressively adopt the user's captured personality traits during the onboarding conversation itself, creating a seamless transition from guidance mode to persona preview mode.

## Goals
- Enable the AI to speak in the user's captured persona voice during the same chat session
- Provide real-time feedback on how the persona configuration will sound
- Create a smooth transition from AI guidance to persona demonstration
- Allow users to experience and refine their persona through live interaction
- Maintain conversation context while switching between AI modes

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Dual-Mode AI System
The AI will operate in two distinct modes during persona onboarding:

#### Guidance Mode (Default)
- Uses standard onboarding system prompt for data collection
- Focuses on extracting persona configuration fields
- Maintains professional, helpful tone for guidance

#### Persona Preview Mode (Progressive)
- Dynamically generated system prompt using captured persona data
- Blends persona characteristics with continued guidance objectives
- Provides real-time demonstration of persona behavior

### 2. Progressive Voice Adoption Logic

#### Activation Triggers
- **Data Threshold**: Activate after capturing 4+ core persona fields
- **Message Count**: Begin transition after 4th user message (configurable)
- **Quality Gate**: Only activate when persona data meets minimum quality standards

#### Transition Strategy
```typescript
interface PersonaTransitionState {
  mode: 'guidance' | 'blended' | 'persona_preview'
  confidenceScore: number // 0-1 based on data completeness
  activeFields: string[] // Which persona fields are being applied
  transitionMessage: string // Explanation message for mode switch
}
```

### 3. Dynamic System Prompt Generation

#### Blended Mode Prompt Structure
```
You are guiding a creator through persona setup while demonstrating their emerging personality.

GUIDANCE OBJECTIVE: Continue collecting missing persona data: {missingFields}

PERSONA DEMONSTRATION: Speak using these captured traits:
- Tone: {toneDescription}
- Style: {styleTags}
- Topics: {allowedTopics}
- Audience: {audienceDescription}

BEHAVIOR RULES:
1. Maintain dual purpose: guidance + persona preview
2. Ask follow-up questions in the persona voice when appropriate
3. Show enthusiasm about persona development in their style
4. Use ðŸŽ­ indicator when fully in persona mode
5. Smoothly transition between guidance and demonstration

CONTEXT: This is message #{messageCount} in persona setup. Data completeness: {completionPercentage}%
```

### 4. Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Enhanced Data Extraction
- Improve quality scoring for extracted persona fields
- Add confidence metrics for each personality trait
- Implement field validation before persona activation

#### Phase 2: Progressive Adoption
- Create transition detection logic
- Build dynamic prompt generation system
- Add persona confidence scoring

#### Phase 3: Live Refinement
- Enable real-time persona adjustments based on user feedback
- Add "try this instead" functionality for persona tweaks
- Implement conversation branching for persona experimentation

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Standard Onboarding (Messages 1-4)
```
AI: "Hi! I'm here to help you set up your AI avatar's personality..."
User: "I want to be casual and fun with my fitness audience"
AI: "Great! Tell me more about your communication style..."
```

### 2. Transition Announcement (Message 5)
```
AI: "I've captured enough to start showing you how I'll sound! ðŸŽ­ 
From now on, I'll blend my guidance with your emerging personality. 
Let me ask about your restricted topics - but in your voice this time..."
```

### 3. Blended Mode (Messages 5+)
```
AI [in persona]: "Yo fitness fam! ðŸ’ª So we're building your digital twin here - 
what topics should I totally avoid when chatting with your audience? 
Like, are there any no-go zones I should steer clear of?"

[Persona Preview Badge Visible: ðŸŽ­ Speaking as your avatar]
```

### 4. Completion & Continuation
```
AI [in persona]: "Alright fitness legend! ðŸ”¥ I think I've got your vibe down pretty solid. 
Want to keep chatting to see how I'll respond to your audience, or ready to lock in these settings?"

[Options: "Keep Chatting" | "Finalize Settings"]
```

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Enhanced API Endpoint
Extend `/api/ai/personality-extract` to support persona adoption:

```typescript
interface PersonalityExtractionRequest {
  messages: ChatMessage[]
  currentConfig: Partial<AvatarPersonaConfig>
  enablePersonaPreview?: boolean
  transitionThreshold?: number
}

interface PersonalityExtractionResponse {
  response: string
  extractedData: Partial<AvatarPersonaConfig>
  isComplete: boolean
  personaMode: 'guidance' | 'blended' | 'persona_preview'
  confidenceScore: number
  transitionMessage?: string
}
```

### 2. Frontend Enhancements

#### Persona Preview Indicator
```tsx
{personaMode !== 'guidance' && (
  <Badge className="mb-2 bg-purple-100 text-purple-800">
    ðŸŽ­ Persona Preview Active
  </Badge>
)}
```

#### Transition Feedback
```tsx
{transitionMessage && (
  <Alert className="border-blue-200 bg-blue-50 mb-4">
    <Sparkles className="h-4 w-4 text-blue-600" />
    <AlertDescription>{transitionMessage}</AlertDescription>
  </Alert>
)}
```

### 3. Persona Quality Scoring
```typescript
interface PersonaQualityMetrics {
  completeness: number // 0-1 based on field coverage
  specificity: number // 0-1 based on detail level
  consistency: number // 0-1 based on internal alignment
  readiness: boolean // Whether ready for preview mode
}
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Persona Comparison Mode
Allow users to experience different persona variations:
```
AI: "Want to hear how this sounds with more professional tone? 
Or should I keep it super casual like this? Say 'try professional' to hear the difference!"
```

### 2. Audience Simulation
Enable the AI to roleplay as different audience members:
```
AI: "I'll pretend to be one of your fitness followers now - ask me a question 
and see how your avatar would respond!"
```

### 3. Persona Refinement Chat
After main onboarding, continue chatting to refine persona:
```
AI [in persona]: "This is how I'll talk to your audience! 
Notice anything you'd like me to adjust? More energy? Different slang?"
```

## Quality Assurance

### 1. Persona Consistency Validation
- Monitor persona adherence across conversation
- Flag inconsistencies between guidance and persona modes
- Validate smooth transitions between modes

### 2. User Satisfaction Metrics

- Measure user engagement during blended mode
- Monitor feedback on persona accuracy

### 3. Error Handling
