## Updating this README

Before making any changes, please:

1. Check the latest `CHANGELOG.md` to ensure youâ€™re not duplicating efforts.
2. Create or update `CHANGELOG.md` with a dated entry in the correct format (`[Added]`, `[Changed]`, `[Fixed]`, `[Removed]`).
3. Add a top-of-file comment in any source file you modify, pointing to the new changelog entry.
4. Provide concise inline comments describing what was changed and why.
5. Submit small, atomic commits.

Following these steps keeps the README and the project history clear for everyone.

## Continuous Integration

This project uses a GitHub Actions workflow located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to
run TypeScript checks and tests on every push.
