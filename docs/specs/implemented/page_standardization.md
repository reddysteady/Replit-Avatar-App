## HTML Structure Template

```tsx
<div className="page-header">
  <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 md:px-8">
    <div className="py-6">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold leading-7 text-gray-900 sm:text-3xl sm:truncate">
        {pageTitle}
      </h1>
      <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-600 max-w-4xl">
        {pageDescription}
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Mobile Considerations
- Headers should be visible and properly sized on mobile devices
- Text should remain readable at smaller screen sizes
- Consistent spacing with existing mobile navigation

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Main conversation pages
2. **Medium Priority**: Settings pages (`/settings/*`)
3. **Low Priority**: Utility pages (testing tools, privacy)

## Accessibility
- Use proper heading hierarchy (h1 for page titles)
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Maintain semantic HTML structure
- Support screen readers with descriptive text

## Quality Assurance
- Test on both desktop and mobile viewports
- Verify consistent spacing and typography
- Ensure descriptions are helpful and accurate
- Check for responsive behavior across screen sizes
