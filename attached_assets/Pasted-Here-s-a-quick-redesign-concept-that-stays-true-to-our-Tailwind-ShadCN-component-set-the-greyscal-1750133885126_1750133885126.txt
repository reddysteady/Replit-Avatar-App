Here’s a quick redesign concept that stays true to our Tailwind + ShadCN component set, the greyscale-with-accent style-guide, and the spec for PrivacyPersonalityForm.tsx, while making the three selector areas faster and less error-prone.

1. “Style Tags” → Token Chips + Presets
Current	Suggested
Six individual check-boxes	Preset chip row + “Custom” text field

Why it’s better

At-a-glance state. Filled chips = selected, outlined = unselected. No hunting for scattered check-boxes.

One-tap clear. Each chip has an “×” that appears on hover for quick removal.

Extensible. If creators want an oddball tag (“Zen-like”), they type it, press Enter, and it converts to a chip.

Implementation notes

tsx
Copy
Edit
import { Badge } from "@/components/ui/badge"
{/* Preset tags */}
{presetStyleTags.map(t => (
  <Badge
    key={t}
    variant={selected.includes(t) ? "default" : "outline"}
    onClick={() => toggleTag(t)}
    className="cursor-pointer rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm"
  >
    {t}
  </Badge>
))}
{/* Free-form input turns into chips on Enter */}
<InputTagField placeholder="Add custom tone…" onAdd={addTag} />
Use electric-blue accent (#3A8DFF) for filled chips, outline-grey by default.

2. “Allowed” & “Restricted Topics” → Dual-column Drag-and-Drop List
Current	Suggested
Separate checkbox lists + free-form inputs	One component, two columns with pills you can drag (or click) between “Allowed” and “Restricted”. “Unclassified” items sit in a tray underneath.

Why it’s better

Single source of truth. A topic can’t be both allowed and restricted by accident.

Faster triage. Users can paste/import a comma-separated list and then sort with drag-and-drop.

Visual hierarchy. Accent-green border for Allowed pills; accent-red border for Restricted.

Micro-interactions

Hover → subtle shadow (Brand §5 hover state).

Dragging pill shows ghost + heading highlight.

Empty column gets a dashed outline prompt: “Drop topics here”.

Implementation hints

tsx
Copy
Edit
<DragDropContext onDragEnd={handleMove}>
  <Droppable droppableId="allowed">
    {/* map allowedTopics into <Draggable> pills */}
  </Droppable>
  <Droppable droppableId="restricted">
    {/* map restrictedTopics */}
  </Droppable>
</DragDropContext>
Radix-based <DndContext> (or @dnd-kit) keeps bundle size low and is ShadCN-friendly.

3. Bulk-Add & Suggestions
Beneath the drag-and-drop columns:

Type-ahead input with popular topic suggestions (“travel tips”, “crypto”, etc.).

Paste a comma-delimited list → tokens appear in the “Unclassified” tray.

Small helper text (“Drag each topic into Allowed or Restricted, or leave blank to ignore.”).

4. “Fallback Response” → Inline Preview
Radio buttons stay, but show the chosen response in a readonly text-area right below for immediate visual feedback.
If the user selects “Custom”, auto-focus the input and show character count (max 150 chars).
