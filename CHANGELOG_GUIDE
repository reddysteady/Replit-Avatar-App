<!-- CHANGELOG_GUIDE.md -->

Zero-ambiguity protocol for updating CHANGELOG.md

0 · TL;DR for Agents

Locate today’s date header (in Pacific Time) (YYYY-MM-DD).

If it already exists → append new lines under it. If not → add the header at the bottom of the file.

Write one entry per line using the pattern [Agent?][Type] Description. (The [Agent] tag is optional for humans.)

Stage & commit the updated file with the code change. No changelog update → ❌ PR rejected.

1 · Entry Format (must be exact)

2025-06-11          ← Date header (YYYY-MM-DD) on its own line. Date must be in Pacific Time.
[Codex][Fixed] Foo bar.   ← Lines start with brackets, no bullets

### Bracket tokens

| Token | When / Why to use |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Agent** | _Optional_ automated-tool prefix, e.g. `[Codex]`, `[ReplitAssistant]` (PascalCase, no spaces) |
| **Type** | **Added · Changed · Fixed · Removed · Security · Deprecated · Docs** |
| **Suffix** | Optional numeric counter, e.g. `[Fixed-3]`, when logging several tightly‑related fixes |

### Description rules
* **Imperative**: `Fix crash` ✔ (`Fixed crash` ✘)
* End with a period.
* ≤ 120 characters.
* Mention file, API, or behaviour briefly: `[Fixed] Conversation thread now aligns outbound messages.`

2 · Day‑to‑Day Algorithm (log steps with [CL])

[CL] Scan diff

files=$(git diff --name-only HEAD~1)
if [ -z "$files" ]; then
  echo "[CL] No code change – abort"; exit 0;
fi

[CL] Classify change

Heuristic

Type

New file

Added

Bug fix / red test → green

Fixed

Behaviour tweak / refactor

Changed

File or feature removed

Removed

[CL] Locate or create date header

today=$(TZ="America/Edmonton" date +"%Y-%m-%d")
grep -q "^$today$" CHANGELOG.md || printf "\n%s\n" "$today" >> CHANGELOG.md

[CL] Append entry lines directly after the header you just ensured.

[CL] Lint

Each line matches ^\[[A-Za-z]+(\][A-Za-z]+)?\] .

No duplicate descriptions within the same date block.

No line exceeds 120 chars.

Single blank line between date blocks.

[CL] Stage & commit

git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs(changelog): update for <feature|fix>"

3 · Examples

Single human entry

2025-06-12 [Changed] Switch image optimization from Imgix to Vite‑Imagemin.

Multiple agent entries, same day

2025-06-13 [Codex][Added] Unit tests for /api/messages DELETE route.
[Codex][Fixed] Null senderId caused blank avatar in ThreadRow.

Mixed agent + human

2025-06-14 [Codex][Removed] Legacy ConversationThread.css.
[Fixed] Message composer now respects Enter‑to‑send on mobile.

4 · Autofix Heuristics (silent corrections)

Violation

Auto‑fix directive

Wrong date header format

Convert to YYYY‑MM‑DD.

Non‑imperative verb

Rewrite to imperative base form.

Trailing whitespace

Strip.

Missing period

Append .

Duplicate blank lines

Collapse to a single blank line between blocks.

5 · Escalate / Require Human Review

Condition

Action

Git diff touches > 50 files

Skip changelog, ping humans (@reviewers).

Ambiguous classification (can’t infer type)

Open GitHub issue titled “Needs manual changelog”.

Legal / security policy changes

Escalate to human reviewer.
